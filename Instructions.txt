Axis2 is not supported directly but as plugins.
Axis2 has to be downloaded from http://archive.apache.org/dist/axis/axis2/java/core/1.6.2/
axis-1.6.2-bin.zip, extract it in separate location.
In eclipse, go to windows, preference and add axi2 preference, give the extracted location and add axis2.
Create dynamic web project.
Create the simple service class. No need of SEI,SIB. Only a simple class without annotation.
Run the service class choosing axis2 server.(new-other-webservice-axis2).
Now the server will run as axis2 server, which will generate the annotation in .CLASS files.
Access the server using http:\\localhost:8080\applicationname
click the service name,
you will get the wsdl.
For Client:
create again a dynamic web project
on src click new-other-webserviceclient-wsdl location and axis2 server
this will generate the stub 
create the TestClient class.
run client as java application and get the output printed.
